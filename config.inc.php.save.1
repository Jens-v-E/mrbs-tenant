// Note that timezones can be set on a per-area basis, so strictly speaking this
// setting should be in areadefaults.inc.php, but as it is so important to set
// the right timezone it is included here.
//
// When upgrading an existing installation, this should be set to the

/*******************
 * Themes
 *******************/

// Choose a theme for the MRBS.   The theme controls two aspects of the look and feel:
//   (a) the styling:  the most commonly changed colours, dimensions and fonts have been
//       extracted from the main CSS file and put into the styling.inc file in the appropriate
//       directory in the Themes directory.   If you want to change the colour scheme, you should
//       be able to do it by changing the values in the theme file.    More advanced styling changes
//       can be made by changing the rules in the CSS file.
//   (b) the header:  the header.inc file which contains the function used for producing the header.
//       This enables organisations to plug in their own header functions quite easily, in cases where
//       the desired corporate look and feel cannot be changed using the CSS alone and the mark-up
//       itself needs to be changed.
//
//  MRBS will look for the files "styling.inc" and "header.inc" in the directory Themes/$theme and
//  if it can't find them will use the files in Themes/default.    A theme directory can contain
//  a replacement styling.inc file or a replacement header.inc file or both.

// Available options are:

// "default"        Default MRBS theme
// "classic126"     Same colour scheme as MRBS 1.2.6

$theme = "default";

// Use the $custom_css_url to override the standard MRBS CSS.
